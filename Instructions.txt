Pushing to Github: (do this so I can also have access to your changes and so that the most current version of the site is stored online)
- The source control tab is the is the one that looks like little branches with circles. Click on it. 
- First, stage the changes by clicking the "changes" dropdown then hitting the plus sign ("stage all changes") and then hit enter.
- Next, create a commit. The changes should move to the "staged changes" dropdown. Above that in another heading, click the checkmark to commit.
- Add a message describing your changes then hit enter.
- Push to github. Do this by hitting the up arrow in the "source control" header. Make sure "push to origin" is higlighted. Hit enter.
- Finally, create a pull request on github.com. Open the github website and go to WarthawgComics by Damion Hill. (should be what I have bookmarked)
- In the header, click "pull requests." Select the green button that says "new pull request"
- Write a comment describing the changes. Submit the request. 
- After this, there's nothing left for you to do. I will review the code and then accept the request.
