This website was designed to adhere to be mobile-first design techniques, with emphasized ease on small mobile devices.  I used media queries, relative units in the specification of sizes, and other responsive web deisng tools in order to make the website as friendly to all devices as possible

## Reflection
Project goals included learning and familiarizing myself with both HTML and CSS as well as the process of front-end web design.  The goals I was given from the business included straightforward navigation, ease in adding/removing comics from the catalog, and encouraging customer interaction.

I originally wanted to build a website where the business owner could most efficiently keep their catalog updated by editing the Publisher files (Marvel, DC, Romance, etc), with minimum knowledge of web development on their part. I chose to implement this by keeping the Publisher files as simply organized as possible, specifically by using CSS Flexbox and having a clear, cohesive format across all  site files.

This project was challenging for me because I was in the process of teaching myself React and JavaScript as I was building the site. The website underwent multiple versions as I became more proficient with these tools.


## Progress
As mentioned above, this website is constantly being updated and changed according to the business owner's current catalog and comic events.  Future goals include more user interaction, such as a checkout cart. 


## Contributing
This website is currently a personal project, and is not looking for any other contributors beyond myself and the business owner.
